```

## Nuxt deployment via Netlify
Make spa mode (not universal)

* Make “New site from git”
* Select Github and repo
* If nuxt
    * Set Build Command to ‘npm run generate’
    * Set publish directory to ‘dist’
    * ‘Deploy site’ and ‘change site name’ / rename afterwards
* push to master and it will deploy. Voila!

## REMEMBER
remember: Making sure to delay Tweens on scroll otherwise two tweens will happen at the same time, causing jumping between states
